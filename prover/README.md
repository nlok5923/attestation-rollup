## Setting up prover
 
- To setup the prover follow the Deploy on Local Network Steps [here](https://github.com/risc0/bonsai-foundry-template/blob/main/deployment-guide.md#deploy-your-project-on-a-local-network)

PS: Don't worry about the interaction part as it has been already taken care by the rollup rpc server
